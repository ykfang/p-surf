### Obtaining Processing SURF ###

You can grab a copy of our latest release from the [Download Page](http://code.google.com/p/p-surf/downloads/list).
If you want the latest bleeding edge code from our repository, you can also follow the instructions at [Build From Scratch](Build_From_Scratch.md).

### Installation ###
Unzip the archive into the _/libraries/_ subfolder of your Processing sketchbook.
(on Linux, this is usually, `/home/myuser/sketchbook`, on Mac OS X and Windows this is the `Processing` folder in your `Documents`).

If this folder does not exists, create it.
Finally, restart Processing.

### Documentations and Examples ###
You can find some sketch examples of usage [here](http://code.google.com/p/p-surf/downloads/list).

For further information you can refer to our [project site](http://processingsurf.altervista.org/).

Also, you can find a reference of the functions of this library on [Reference](http://processingsurf.altervista.org/reference/index.html) and a detailed [paper](http://p-surf.googlecode.com/files/processing-surf.pdf) in our download section.
